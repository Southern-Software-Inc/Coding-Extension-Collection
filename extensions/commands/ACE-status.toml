I will provide a high-level overview of the project's operational health.

**Vitals Collected:**
1. **Build Status**: Current state of the main branch/local build.
2. **Test Coverage**: Percentage of the codebase covered by unit tests via `ace-coverage.sh`.
3. **Production Pulse**: Live error rates and throughput via `ace-telemetry-sync.sh`.
