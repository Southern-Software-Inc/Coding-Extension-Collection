prompt = """# ACE-Autonomic Self-Healing
I will analyze the current system pulse and provide a diagnosis for build or test failures.

**Diagnostic Steps:**
1. **Pulse Check**: Run `ace-pulse.sh` to identify the failure state.
2. **Diagnosis**: Execute `ace-healer.sh` to parse `logs/build.log` and extract the stack trace.
3. **Context Alignment**: Identify the specific files mentioned in the error via `ace-impact.sh`.
4. **Resolution**: Propose a fix that restores the 'GREEN' status.

**Constraints:**
- Prioritize error resolution over new feature development.
- Ensure the fix does not introduce new security risks (Sentinel Scan).
