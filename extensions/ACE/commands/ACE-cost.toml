prompt = """# ACE-Cost Attribution
I will analyze the economic impact of the current module and the token efficiency of our session.

**Analysis Parameters:**
1. **Cloud Spend**: Run `ace-cost-analyzer.sh` to attribute infrastructure costs to the target logic.
2. **Token Budget**: Use `ace-budgeter.sh` to evaluate the current context-to-token ratio.
3. **Optimization**: Suggest logic changes to reduce IOPS, compute time, or memory footprint.

**Goal**: Minimize Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) while maintaining performance.
