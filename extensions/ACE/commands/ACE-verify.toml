prompt = """# ACE-Nexus Post-Flight Verification
I will verify the last generated code block to ensure it is architecturally compliant and type-safe.

**Verification Steps:**
1. **Type Check**: Run `ace-verifier.sh` to ensure all referenced types exist in the context.
2. **Blueprint Match**: Validate against the architectural patterns in `ace-blueprint.sh`.
3. **Structural Integrity**: Ensure no truncated logic or unbalanced braces.

**Action**: If verification fails, I will automatically provide a corrected version.
